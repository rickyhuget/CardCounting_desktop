# CardCounting_desktop
Application to practice Hi-Lo card counting system.
It generates a deck of cards and tracks a 'running count' that starts at 0.
The user is meant to track the running count in their own head.
When a card is displayed the running count is changed accordingly.
A card of value 2 through 6 displayed increments the running count by 1.
A card of value 7 through 9 does not change the running count.
A card of value 10 or a face card decrements the running count by 1.
The card deck will diplay 40 to 50 cards in that deck consecutively.
Once finished, the running count will be displayed.
The user can then see if their own running count matches the correct running count.
